# Sprint 6: Testing Mobile Applications


# Project 6: Task
The team has developed its first version of the Urban Lunch app. It's an Android app that allows customers to order meals from different restaurants in the city, and then collect them from one of the pickup points. Your task is to test this application.

# Here is an overview of how the process works:
The user selects a restaurant/collection point, chooses a dish or dishes, and then confirms their order.

# Your task
1. Read through the requirements for the Urban Lunch mobile app to make sure you are familiar with them. The layouts are in Figma. If there is a difference between the layouts and the requirements, use the requirements.
2. Write a checklist for testing the Urban Lunch app. The requirements you need to focus on are highlighted with a yellow background. 
3. Download the Urban Lunch app and install it on a device in your emulator. Use the Pixel 5 that you created during the sprint.
4. Test the mobile app in the emulator and create bug reports in Jira for any bugs that you find. During the test, mark the results of the test: PASSED or FAILED. If the test is FAILED, remember to add a link to your bug report into the corresponding column of the table.
